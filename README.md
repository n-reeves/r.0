# r.0
First iteration in a continuing effort to explore the creative potential of generative models in music.

The Colab notebook provides a tutorial on how to use the Jukebox package in a Colab environment to train a VQ-VAE, prior, and upsampler on your own set of songs or sounds. I found almost all the existing documentation on Jukebox is focused on leveraging the pre-existing models OpenAI has trained to generate audio.

While it has many limitations, this method is a good way to experiment with training unique generative musical models without thousands of dollars of hardware or cloud computing resources.
